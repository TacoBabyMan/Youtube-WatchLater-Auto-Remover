# Youtube-WatchLater-Auto-Remover

# What is does-
The Youtube auto watchlater remover will automatically remove the video from your watchlater playlist.

Every time you navigate the "Watch Later" playlist on Youtube and open a video in a seperate tab it will eject you from the "Watch Later playlist".

There is an option to have it auto-remove the video from the playlist when you have opened this video in a new tab.(Picture of what the icon looks like)
